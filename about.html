				<h3>Past</h3>
				<p>
					Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist of One Piece, was born in Foosha Village in East Blue. As a child, Luffy idolized Shanks, the captain of the Red-Haired Pirates, who became a key influence on his dream of becoming the Pirate King. Shanks' sacrifice to save Luffy, resulting in the loss of his arm, left an indelible mark on Luffy’s resolve. At age 7, Luffy ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi (later revealed to be the Hito Hito no Mi: Model Nika), a Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber, granting him extraordinary abilities at the cost of his ability to swim. He set out to sea at 17, aiming to find the legendary One Piece treasure and fulfill his dream of ultimate freedom.
				</p>
				<p>
					Luffy’s journey brought him incredible allies and battles. Early on, he formed the Straw Hat Pirates, starting with Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji, expanding to include Chopper, Robin, Franky, Brook, and Jinbe. Luffy faced powerful foes like Crocodile, Enel, and Doflamingo, each battle refining his skills and determination. His greatest trials included losing his brother Ace during the Paramount War and later training under Rayleigh to master Haki. These experiences deepened Luffy’s understanding of his responsibilities as a leader and his role in shaping the future.

				<h3>Present</h3>
				<p>
					Now, Luffy stands as one of the most powerful pirates in the New World. As a member of the Worst Generation and the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, he’s become a force that even the World Government fears. His defeat of Kaido in Wano cemented his reputation as an Emperor of the Sea. Despite his growing fame, Luffy remains the same spirited dreamer, determined to uncover the truth of the Void Century, topple oppressive regimes, and ultimately claim the title of King of the Pirates, fulfilling his promise to himself and his crew.
